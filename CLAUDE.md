## Architecture Overview

This is a React application built with Vite, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui components, serving as both a TD Studios business website and a cannabis dispensary/menu system with dual architecture.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite with SWC compiler (configured with React namespace support)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with optional Neon serverless integration
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Testing**: Playwright for end-to-end testing
- **SEO**: react-helmet-async for document head management
- **Dev Server**: Vite dev server on port 8081 (or next available), accessible on all interfaces

### Dual Application Architecture

**CoreLayout Routes** (TD Studios Main Site):

- `/` - TD Studios homepage with premium design showcase
- `/shop` - Customer shopping interface (cannabis products)
- `/web`, `/dev`, `/social`, `/portfolio` - TD Studios service pages
- `/mylar-designs` - Mylar packaging design gallery
- `/custom-designs` - Custom design services
- `/social-content` - Social media content packs
- `/digital-assets` - Digital design assets and downloads
- `/custom-mylar-form` - Custom mylar request form
- `/custom-websites` - Website development services
- `/referral` - Referral program
- `/contact` - Contact form
- `/checkout` - Shopping cart checkout flow

**Standalone Routes** (No CoreLayout):

- `/admin` - Super admin dashboard
- `/brand` - Brand/dispensary dashboard
- `/auth` - Authentication page
- `/tdstudios`, `/bagman_ny`, `/quickprintz`, etc. - Individual brand pages

**Developer Routes**:

- `/__builder` - Page builder interface
- `/__auth-builder` - Auth card builder
- `/__card-editor` - Mass card editor
- `/__components` - Component library
- `/__ping` - Router health check
- `/test-tdstudios` - Development testing page

### Key Architecture Patterns

**CoreLayout System**:

- `src/layouts/CoreLayout.tsx` - Unified header/footer for TD Studios pages
- Sticky header with centered TD STUDIOS logo (clickable to home)
- Desktop: Logo above navigation, MYLAR dropdown menu
- Mobile: Logo + hamburger menu with collapsible navigation
- Footer with company info and quick links

**Navigation Structure**:

- Main menu: HOME, SHOP, WEBSITES, REFERRAL, CONTACT
- No dropdown menus - simplified flat navigation
- Shopping cart button with quantity indicator
- Mobile: Hamburger menu with collapsible navigation and cart access

**Role-Based Access**:

- `admin` role → `/admin` dashboard
- `brand` role → `/brand` dashboard
- Default/customer → TD Studios pages with shopping

**Key Components**:

- `CustomerApp` - Shopping interface (now without header, uses CoreLayout)
- `SuperAdminDashboard` - Admin management
- `BrandDashboard` - Brand/dispensary management
- `CheckoutFlow` - Purchase process
- `AuthPage` - Authentication handling

**Database Integration**:

- **Optional Database Architecture**: `src/db/index.ts` provides `DB_ENABLED` flag and `requireDB()` function
- **Environment Control**: Set `VITE_ENABLE_DB=true` to enable database features
- **Primary Database**: Supabase authentication and data (Project ID: `crpalakzdzvtgvljlutd`)
- **Alternative Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL (`@neondatabase/serverless`)
- 17+ migrations in `supabase/migrations/`
- User roles in `user_roles` table (admin, brand, customer)
- TypeScript types generated in `supabase/types.ts`
- TanStack Query for server state management
- **Graceful Degradation**: UI components handle database-disabled scenarios

**Styling System**:

- shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
- Glassmorphism effects throughout (bg-white/5, backdrop-blur-md)
- Theme support via next-themes
- Path alias `@/` points to `src/`

### Design Philosophy

**TD Studios Brand**:

- Luxury/premium aesthetic with glassmorphism
- Cannabis industry focus with mylar packaging specialization
- Professional service offerings (websites, design, social content)
- Consistent header/navigation across all main pages

**Development Patterns**:

- Route-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- CoreLayout for unified TD Studios experience
- Standalone routes for admin/brand functionality
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Component reusability with shadcn/ui system

## Shop System Architecture

**Data Priority Flow**:

1. `public/_shop-layout.json` - Published layout (order/text override)
2. `public/_shop-manifest.json` - Build-time generated from `td slide` and `shoppagepics` folders
3. Dev middleware `/__list-public` - Live folder listing in development
4. Hardcoded fallback products

**Shop Editing Workflow**:

- Edit Mode: drag to reorder, inline edit titles/descriptions, select/delete items
- Save Layout: stores in browser localStorage only
- Export JSON: downloads shop-layout.json for publishing
- Publish: place exported file at `public/_shop-layout.json`, commit, deploy

**Cart System**:

- Global cart state via `useCart` hook with localStorage persistence
- Cart preview slide-out with quantity controls and item management
- Integrated into CoreLayout header with count indicator

## Development Scripts & Automation

**Page Generation**:

- `npm run gen:page` - Interactive script creates new page component and auto-adds routing to App.tsx
- Vite dev middleware `/__scaffold` - Development-only page creation endpoint (POST endpoint for programmatic page creation)

**Asset Management**:

- `scripts/generate-shop-manifest.mjs` - Scans `public/td slide` and `public/shoppagepics` for images, excludes specific files, outputs `_shop-manifest.json`
- Automatic execution during `npm run build`
- OCR scripts for batch image processing

**Testing Framework**:

- **Playwright E2E Testing**: Configuration in `playwright.config.ts`
- **Test Files**: `e2e/routes.spec.ts` - Core routing and SPA functionality tests
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow (`/.github/workflows/e2e.yml`) runs tests on push/PR
- **Test Environment**: Tests run against production build on port 8081

**Documentation**:

- `npm run capture:all` - Playwright screenshots of all pages
- Auto-generated screenshot gallery at `screenshots/index.html`

**Deployment**:

- Vercel auto-deploy on main branch push
- Manual deploy via `npm run deploy:hook` (reads `VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` from `.env.local`)

## Project Context

This serves as both:

1. **TD Studios Business Website** - Professional design services for cannabis brands
2. **Cannabis Dispensary System** - Multi-tenant ordering and management platform

The dual nature requires careful routing: main business pages use CoreLayout for consistency, while admin/brand functionality remains separate for specialized workflows.
